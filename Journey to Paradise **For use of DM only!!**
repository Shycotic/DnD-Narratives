Plot intro:

Legends speak of a mystical society where the people and the authorities have practiced and achieved true peace and harmony with one another.
There is no crime, no dishonesty, no ill will, no negative tropes of any kind amongst the people. It is said that everyone works together peacefully.
Such harmony isn't common in the regular world, so it's truly a strange spectacle, but an interesting one.

The rumors that have reached far travelers' ears have spurred the interest of do-gooders and evil ones alike. Some wish to take advantage of the seemingly docile people and rule them all--their rumored riches under their control. There are those who wish to study the behavior of their infrastructure, and see how it is truly possible to achieve societal greatness. And others just wish to find this land, in hopes of living amongst the kind people and leaving the current dystopia they now reside in. 

Given the amount of people that wish to find this hidden land, and the available means to travel, you would think that this fabled city would be found by now... but a new rumor has arisen in this stead:
It is said that the "land" is not of the ground, but of the sky. A floating, mechanical zeppelin that sails near the outer reaches of the stratosphere. As for spotting it? It's near impossible...
This flying utopia is surrounded by a light reflecting barrier that renders it invisible to the naked eye. 
That's not the worst part of it, it seems that many don't even get the chance to enter the city upon reaching it, for the only sign that anyone is getting close is represented by a horde of Berbalangs. Their group size rivaling that of a migrating flock of geese. And at the head of the herd are three air elementals, adamant to striking anyone down who aims to enter the city. (As a roll to insight, you can see that these elementals are actually chaotic good...which will make sense later.)

Should anyone wish to find the legendary zeppelin of peace, all the luck.

Somehow, some way, with some unimaginable amount of determination, the group has found it. This city has a name as well, "Hidat-Albasar". Sure enough it's people greet you with kindness and wonder. They don't get many visitors, and due to your troubles it's easy to see why, however it doesn't seem like that people are aware of how effective their camoflauged defenses are...
When asked about the wings demons outside their walls, the people don't realize what you're talking about, claiming the most 'frightening' thing here are ghost stories.

The travelers are showered with gifts and food as well as questions to their origins. A great festival is had to welcome the newcomers, with more food and gifts, as per order of their leader, who goes by the name "Kameel".
The leader is no where to be found but the townsfolk assure that they'll get to meet him later in the week. After the festival ends the townsfolk, strangely--as if they all got up at once (but not quite), decide to retire for the night and urge the party to take shelter in one of their inns. Free of charge for the night. The party can rest up, buy food, drink alcohol, or even train until the next morning. If they decide to investigate why all the townsfolk decided to call it a night at roughly the same time, they will see that all of their houses are firmly locked. Upon closer inspection. All of the houses are branded with an unrecognizable glyph...seemingly for protection. Nonetheless, their doors won't open and the people inside each house do not respond until the morning.

During the next three days the party can gain knowledge on how their utopian society works so flawlessly (to which they'll stress the importance of Kameel and give thanks to him), learn how they've become so rich in both culture and riches (and again they'll credit Kameel), and how they stay so warm, carefree and...normal(?) up in the clouds, without need for much oxygen or proper regulation of sunlight and wind chill (and again, they give thanks to Kameel...and the security glyphs).

All this talk of Kameel has sparked interest, or disdain, in him and one way or another the only way to find out more about him is to actually meet him. All attempts to meet this great leader are thwarted by the village elders (although they dont look a day over 35...) and they stress, almost uncomfortably, that they MUST wait to meet Kameel until their third day. The reason? He must rest after his last "Summons Day". This Summons Day isn't explained much other than a 'glorious occasion when Kameel calls upon the God of Anhur (an Egyptian sky god) to continue to rain blessings upon the city of Hidat-Albasar. It's a lot of pressure to talk to a god such as he directly'.

(If anyone wants to leave before then, they cannot. The gates to the edge city are sealed off with some sort of glyph, similar to the glyphs on the people's doors. Any attempt to just fly off the zeppelin can result in suffocation. They ARE on the edge of the stratosphere. )

Plot Climax:

From the second day into the third day the party notices that the townsfolk as a whole begin to look more and more...translucent. Although their cheerful disposition hasn't wavered, their eyes look more sunken in, glossy, pupils dulled and cloudy like a fish. They don't seem to notice that though.
Any attempt to find out what's wrong leads them to change the subject quickly. 
On the third day, some of the townsfolk as well as the elders happily announce that Kameel is ready to see them now. Upon closer inspection to the rest of the Albasites, their movements are robotic, and twitchy as they carry out their daily tasks of tending the crops, shopping for food, and the like. At this point the elders won't let you do anything else but see Kameel like you wanted. 

Like. You. Wanted.

Any attempt to enter a separate building will have that person met with the same protective glyph. The group is ushered towards the leader's quarters: a grand open door leading downwards into a bronze corridor pathway beneath the city. Once the elders lead you to the corridor and begin to close the door, their passive smiles slowly turn into sympathetic frowns.

Add any optional encounters here? Or treasure. Or both. Doesn't matter much really. One thing that does matter is if the group comes along a shard of gypsum. It could be a drop from a beast or hidden in the mechanical walls. It doesn't look like much at first, but with a 18+ arcana check they will know that this gypsum is actually imbued with magical properties. Magical fire properties. It's kind of important that they find this gypsum and keep it. It's the easy way out of the confrontation.

Final plot conflict: (and the conflict bosses should not be altered in any way. I want this to be GOD AWFUL for everyone. But the rewards should be nice~)

Before the group enters the final chamber, they see a series of cells, jail cells. Each cell reeks with the stench of death and blood. Clearly, who ever was in these cells was roughed up a bit before they met their inevitable demise. Were the townsfolk not aware of how sinister their famed leader is? Or do they just live in fear? Or...do they live at all?
In one middle cell, the group can hear some garbled coughs from someone. They sound like they're trying not to choke on their own bodily fluids. 
Should the group choose to investigate the coughing, they will find a beaten up, badly injured half orc named Judas, a recent adventurer to Hidat-Albasar in search of knowledge and power from the city. Judas will beg for help from the group and also warn them that what lies up ahead is far out of their league. "You have a better chance of trying to force a dragon into a thimble than trying to defeat her".
Judas will explain that this is no utopia. It's a prison. A heavy facade over a dystopian zeppelin. And this Kameel that the "townsfolk" speak of is not a man of progress, but a she-demon, bent on devouring mortals and torturing the soul that's left behind. She seeks strong willed soldiers to collect their essence and rule the skies for all eternity...and she's not half bad at it so far.

If they ask about the air elementals that guarded the gates, its revealed that they try to stop adventures from entering the city to their own demise. Granted, they shouldn't care much in mortal squabbles, but those dead bodies that are left over have attracted the attention of Berbalangs in hordes, and have made the skies a dangerous place for all avian life. In truth, the air elementals don't control the winged demons, they're just trying to corral them into one area so they don't pollute the skies.

The group can either help Judas and reap higher rewards from his family when he returns to them, or leave him behind to die. Or they can rob him(He has 50 gold, a half eaten leg of mutton, a Bag of Beans, a bejeweled flail with missing spikes, and an amulet of health...which is literally the only thing keeping him from dying in this moment).
Should they choose to help Judas, he won't join them in the fight, but he will stay safe from the battle. Consider Judas a team member. But not really.

At last the group has reached this chamber of impending doom.
To greet them, a pair of vile smelling Hezrous (make a constitution saving throw) stand guard in front of a six armed woman, her bottom half is that of a snake. She seems to be busy tending to and operating a large, complicated machine; pulling levers, pushing buttons, twisting knobs here and there. The machine is settled firmly in the walls of the chamber. Its quickly realized that this machine is powering the zeppelin, this woman its pilot.

The woman turns to the group, a fanged smile adorning her face.
She is dressed head to toe in Cleopatra inspired garbs, jewelry, and accented crown to boot. To her sides are six ornately crafted scimitars, all varying shades of brown and red...dried blood from the last victim you presume. 
"Ah~ visitors! Oh, you must have traveled far to reach this place. Here, let me pull up a chair."
She slithers over to the right side of the chamber, its mechanical walls whirring and the gears clank to life. The wall opens up in a complicated fashion as a dangerous looking contraption is fashioned from the very walls. As the mechanical arms settle, its revealed that an electric chair-type seat, covered with hollow spikes and prods on the arm rest, back of the chair, and bottom of the chair, has been drawn from the wall. To everyone's surprise, a withered body has still been affixed to the chair, to which the woman responds, 
"...Whoops, how vile. You stupid oafs (gestures to the Hezrous), I thought I told you to clean this thing after every contribution! I dont want my metal rusting! Would you rather become the next offering?! Hm?"
To which the Hezrous tremble. 
With an annoyed sigh, she takes one hand and peels the rotted corpse off the chair with a sickening series of cracks and tears from the body and throws it haphazardly into an open chute in the floor. Screeching and growls from the Berbalang are heard from the bottom of the chute and the opening closes back up.

She continues her spiel, 
"Where was I...oh yes, offering you all a seat. Well...the surprise factor wasted away due to something's forgetfulness, but no matter. 
If it wasn't obvious before, this is where my grand army of souls have come to meet their end...and their new beginning! A life of servitude to their all-powerful 'Kameel' ". 

The machine that Kameel was operating did not solely power the zeppelin, but also this strange chair. The chair's purpose? To act like a mechanical Cadaver Collector. The victims that find the city of Hidat-Albasar are killed by this machine and their souls are forever tethered to both the zeppelin and the rule of Kameel. The spikes siphon the spirit of the body and feed it to the zeppelin as well as slowly and surely killing the host until they inevitably bleed out and die or just die from shock. 
At the head of this grave operation is this female Marilith who goes by the name Kameel. It seems as if what Judas revealed to the group was true after all...

Final Combat Outcomes:

-Whoever makes the first move of the group towards Kameel rolls disadvantage and automatically triggers aggression from any one of the Hezrous. 

**Here's the easy way out**
-In the event that the group has the gypsum still on their person, they can opt to make their way over to the machine that Kameel was operating and insert the gem into a conveniently shaped hole near one of the ornate levers. Once the gypsum is inserted, the lever next to it will start to glow, enticing whoever's there to pull it. 
Once pulled, the ceiling of the zeppelin chamber will whirr to life and open up to reveal a multi-faceted orb. In one turn, the orb will turn to Kameel and her Hezrou henchmen and fire a blinding red ray from one of the facets. The ray will disintegrate the enemies and leave behind half of their loot (which half? I'll leave that up to you). A booming voice will echo throughout the chamber and say, 
"You who has doused the flames of evil, what is your command?"

-The player can then either assume control over the zeppelin and own it, SOLELY under their control, or ask for the zeppelin to land and end it's time servitude. Turns out that the zeppelin is also a gargantuan living entity, with the spirits of the townsfolk influencing its speech. It wouldn't have revealed itself unless this gypsum key was inserted in its controls. Lucky you.

-Defeating just Kameel will make both Hezrou flee, since you just killed a being stronger than them. 

-Defeating both Hezrou will enrage Kameel and she'll have advantage on attack rolls, but disadvantage against magical spells that can inhibit her movement and resolve. 

-Defeating everyone in the chamber will net strong rewards from the bodies, including the scimitars that Kameel wielded (I'll explain the rewards from the bodies later.)
In the unlikely event that Kameel is mind controlled, and ONLY mind controlled into submission, the group can choose to sacrifice her to the zeppelin or the Hezrou. 

-If you want to side with Kameel, you essentially surrender your body and character as a whole at her disposal. You can't play that character anymore unless Kameel dies. In which case, you lose trust from your group.

-Should the group accidentally (or purposely) damage the machine that pilots the ship, the battle still continues but keep in mind that and ALL METAL zeppelin is now plummeting to the ground from more than 50 miles in the air at an increasing rate of speed. They have 20 turns to get out with Judas, end the battle quickly, or find a way to make the zeppelin stop falling or risk a TPK. The damage taken from this if they stay is literally 40 D20 bludgeoning, slashing, and piercing damage. As an added "fuck you" the spirits of all players and characters are now trapped in a broken zeppelin and can never find rest. And Kameel will be royally pissed.

-If the party finds a way to override the controls of the zeppelin AND defeat Kameel and co., they can keep the zeppelin and the souls trapped on board. But the zeppelin can only be used once a month for travel. If people find out that the group has the fabled town of Hidat-Albasar in their possession, they'll be attacked by bandits at least once a week. But at least you get a freakin zeppelin-town with (relatively) low spirits at your command. 

-If the party manages to leave, they miss out on all the loot, must forfeit the rescue of Judas, and roll high enough in Acrobatics/Strength to escape the controlled souls of the townsfolk, the clutches of Kameel and the Hezrous, and manage to not die when they leap off the zeppelin. The gates to the city are open. They must also roll to survive the still lingering horde of Berbalangs underneath the camoflauged town. Keep in mind then, that Kameel will not rest until she has the group back on that ship and a slave to her army and will send the Hezrous after you. If they kill those initial two, then Hezrou per the command of Kameel will appear randomly throughout the rest of the quest until they deal with her and the zeppelin. 

-**In the event that the group can now control the zeppelin, they cannot release the spirits on board without shutting down the aircraft forever. The spirits understand that they are now slave to it for all eternity. This isn't a curse that can be broken.**

Loot layouts:

From Judas' rescue and return to family:
