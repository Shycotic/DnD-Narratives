Legends speak of a mystical society where the people and the authorities have practiced and achieved true peace and harmony with one another.
There is no crime, no dishonesty, no ill will, no negative tropes of any kind amongst the people. It is said that everyone works together peacefully.
Such harmony isn't common in the regular world, so it's truly a strange spectacle, but an interesting one.

The rumors that have reached far travelers' ears have spurred the interest of do-gooders and evil ones alike. Some wish to take advantage of the seemingly docile people and rule them all--their rumored riches under their control. There are those who wish to study the behavior of their infrastructure, and see how it is truly possible to achieve societal greatness. And others just wish to find this land, in hopes of living amongst the kind people and leaving the current dystopia they now reside in. 

Given the amount of people that wish to find this hidden land, and the available means to travel, you would think that this fabled city would be found by now... but a new rumor has arisen in this stead:
It is said that the "land" is not of the ground, but of the sky. A floating, mechanical zeppelin that sails near the outer reaches of the stratosphere. As for spotting it? It's near impossible...
This flying utopia is surrounded by a light reflecting barrier that renders it invisible to the naked eye. 
That's not the worst part of it, it seems that many don't even get the chance to enter the city upon reaching it, for the only sign that anyone is getting close is represented by a horde of Berbalangs. Their group size rivaling that of a migrating flock of geese. And at the head of the herd are three air elementals, adamant to striking anyone down who aims to enter the city. 

Should anyone wish to find the legendary zeppelin of peace, all the luck.
